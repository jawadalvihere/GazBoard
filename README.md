# GazBoard

**A free-form whiteboard that runs entirely on your own device.**

</div>

A free-form digital whiteboard for Windows, Linux, Android, and macOS — an offline rebuild of the classic **Microsoft Whiteboard 21.x** experience, with one deliberate difference: **no Microsoft sign-in and no cloud. **** 

Everything runs locally. On top of the original feature set, it can **import Word, PowerPoint, and PDF files** onto the canvas as pages you draw over.

## Get it

| Platform | File | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows 10 / 11** | `GazBoard-Setup-*.exe` | Run it. No admin rights needed. |
| **Windows — portable** | `GazBoard-*-portable.exe` | Just run it. Nothing is installed. |
| **Android** | `GazBoard-*-android-v*.apk` | Just download the APK and install; Allow to install if prompted by Play Protect |
| **macOS — Apple Silicon** | `GazBoard-*-arm64.dmg` | Open it, drag to Applications. See the note below. |
| **macOS — Intel** | `GazBoard-*.dmg` | Open it, drag to Applications. See the note below. |
| **Ubuntu / Debian** | `gazboard_*_amd64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./gazboard_*.deb` |
| **Other Linux** | `GazBoard-*.AppImage` | `chmod +x` it and run it |

Not sure which Mac you have? Apple menu →  About This Mac. **Apple M1/M2/M3/M4** means Apple Silicon; anything saying **Intel** takes the other file.

The **portable** build installs nothing and keeps everything — boards, pictures, settings — in a `GazBoard-Data` folder next to the `portable.exe`. Put those on a USB stick and your work travels with it; run it on a school or office PC and nothing is left behind. If the .exe sits somewhere it cannot write, it falls back to the normal per-user folder rather than refusing to start.

### In a browser, without installing anything

There is now a web build as well: **<https://gazboard.fahim9778.workers.dev/>**

It is the same board — the same pens, the same import, the same export — running in the browser instead of as an installed app. It works offline once loaded, and
it can be installed to your home screen or desktop from the browser's own menu.

Two things to know before you rely on it:

- **It is newer than the desktop app and less tested.** The desktop version is the one to use for anything that matters.
- **Your boards live in that browser, on that device.** They are stored in the browser's own storage, not in a file and not in any cloud, so they do not follow you to another machine, and clearing your browsing data clears them. ***_Export anything you want to keep._***

The web build was contributed by [Aditya Banik](https://github.com/voidplacer).

### None of the downloads are code-signed, so each system might complain once, for the first-time only

The app is the same on all three; signing certificates cost money that has not been spent yet.
Every warning below is about the missing signature, not about the app.

**Windows** shows a blue **“Windows protected your PC”** box — click **More info → Run anyway**.

### macOS first run workaround

**macOS** refuses the first launch, and its wording is alarming: either *“the developer cannot be verified”* or ***“GazBoard is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.”*** Nothing is damaged. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, click **Open Anyway**, and confirm. macOS remembers, so this is once per install. If it still refuses, clear the download flag your browser attached:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/GazBoard.app
```

**Linux** does not complain at all. If the AppImage says it requires FUSE:
`sudo apt install libfuse2`, or unpack it with `./GazBoard-*.AppImage --appimage-extract` and run
`squashfs-root/gazboard`.

---

## Running it

```bash
npm install      # pulls Electron (~200 MB) — the app's own libraries are already vendored
npm start
```

Development mode with DevTools: `npm run dev`

### Building installers

```bash
npm run dist:win     # NSIS installer + portable .exe
npm run dist:mac     # .dmg + .zip
npm run dist:linux   # AppImage + .deb
```

Installers land in `dist/`. Build on the target OS (or use a CI matrix) — electron-builder
does not cross-compile Windows installers from Linux without extra tooling.

On Linux, the AppImage needs FUSE 2 to run. Most desktops already have it; on newer Ubuntu
it is `sudo apt install libfuse2`. Otherwise `./GazBoard-*.AppImage --appimage-extract`
unpacks it and `squashfs-root/gazboard` runs directly. The `.deb` has no such requirement.

---

## What it does

### Canvas
- Infinite pan/zoom canvas (5 %–800 %), pinch-zoom and trackpad panning
- Boards always open at 100%, centred on wherever you were last looking — a saved zoom of 36%
  from fitting a document no longer greets you on the next launch
- **The stylus inks, the mouse points.** The first time a stylus touches the tablet the app
  remembers it, and from then on the mouse stops being a pen: with the pen or highlighter
  selected, a mouse press on an object selects and drags it, and a drag on bare canvas pans. Tablet in one hand, mouse in the
  other, no conflict and nothing to switch. On a machine that has never seen a stylus the
  mouse draws as normal, so a mouse-only setup is unaffected. Settings ▸ Inking ▸ *Draw with
  the mouse* pins it to Always or Never if you'd rather not rely on detection.
- Notes, text, shapes, tables, select, lasso and the eraser all still take the mouse — only
  inking is reserved for the stylus.
- With an ink tool active the mouse drags objects and pans, but leaves no selection behind:
  handles and the selection bar belong to Select and Lasso, so they never clutter your
  handwriting.
- Colours are sticky: recolour something from the selection bar and the next pen stroke, note,
  text box or shape of that kind starts in the same colour.
- Holding a mouse button *during* a stylus stroke drags the canvas under the moving pen; the
  scroll wheel does the same.
- **Edge auto-pan** — run the pen (or a dragged object) into the edge of the window and the
  canvas scrolls on its own, speed rising the closer you get. The stroke carries on unbroken.
  Toggle in Settings.
- Backgrounds: eight paper colours plus a custom picker, and plain / grid / dots / lines /
  columns / graph patterns that scale sensibly with zoom
- Fit-to-board, reset zoom, zoom readout

### Inking
- Pen with pressure support (Wacom, Surface Pen, any PointerEvent-capable stylus), five
  thicknesses, twelve colours. A stroke is drawn as **one stroked path down its centreline**,
  curved through the midpoints of the samples. That has two properties worth the words: a
  midpoint curve stays inside its control triangle so it can never overshoot into a loop or a
  spike, and a single `stroke()` call rasterises the whole stroke once so a highlighter that
  crosses itself cannot darken at the overlap. Width is constant along a stroke, like a felt
  pen; pressure sets the weight of the whole stroke rather than wobbling along it.
- **Ink is kept exactly as drawn.** Points are stored as captured — nothing is thinned or
  re-fitted when you lift the pen, so the stroke you were watching is the stroke you keep.
- Highlighter with multiply blending, six colours, four widths
- Pen-tail-button erasing on styluses that report it
- **Partial (point) erase** — dragging the eraser rubs ink out where it crosses, splitting a
  stroke into the runs that survive rather than deleting the whole thing. Four eraser sizes.
- Eraser modes: *erase parts of ink* (default), *erase whole objects*, *erase everything*
- The eraser **grows as you scrub** — keep going and it widens up to 2.8x, then returns to the
  size you picked when you lift, so clearing an area is one sweep rather than forty passes
- Lasso select, then drag from inside the selection to move it without changing tools
- **Straighten shapes I draw** (off by default) — a hand-drawn line, arrow, rectangle, circle,
  ellipse, triangle, diamond, pentagon or hexagon snaps to clean geometry when you lift the
  pen. The guess is checked against your ink before it is accepted: the candidate outline is
  sampled and every point measured against it, so a scribble that happens to have four corners
  is left as ink. One undo always returns the original stroke.
- **Ruler** — drag to move, scroll over it to rotate (Shift for 5° steps); ink snaps to its edge

### Objects
- Sticky notes in eight colours and three sizes, with auto-fitting text
- Text boxes with five sizes, alignment and a handwriting font option. Sizes are what you see:
  a 32px text box or a 200px note placed while zoomed out to 36% is created large enough in
  board units to still measure 32px and 200px on screen.
- Placing a note or a text box hands the board back to the pen the moment you finish typing,
  so the next stylus touch writes instead of dragging a marquee. Editing existing text from
  Select stays in Select.
- A text box shrinks to fit what you typed; a long line wraps at the width it started with
  rather than running off. Resize it by hand and that size is kept.
- Clicking existing text or a note with the Text or Note tool selects and opens it rather than
  dropping a new one on top.
- Fourteen shapes (rectangle, rounded rectangle, ellipse, triangle, right triangle, diamond,
  pentagon, hexagon, octagon, star, cloud, line, arrow, double arrow) with outline, fill and
  line-weight controls, and text inside any of them
- Tables with editable cells and a header row
- Images: insert, paste from clipboard, or drag and drop
- Full transform model — move, resize from eight handles, rotate, Shift-constrain,
  arrow-key nudge, z-order
- Transform handles work under **any** tool: if you can see a handle you can drag it, without
  switching back to Select first
- **Lock** pins an object in place: it shows a padlock badge, marquee select and the eraser
  skip it, Delete leaves it alone, and it has no drag handles. Click it to select it, then use
  the unlock button on the selection bar (or right-click ▸ Unlock) to release it.
- **Annotations belong to what they are drawn on.** Lock an imported page, mark it up, and the
  ink is attached to it: unlock the page and move, resize or rotate it, and the annotations
  travel with it. Delete the page and they go too — undo restores the pair. This is how
  marking up a document is meant to work, and it is why locking exists.
- Dragging with an ink tool draws a dashed outline of what you have hold of, so you can see
  what is moving even though there is no persistent selection in that mode.

### Selection
- Marquee select, **lasso select**, Shift to add or remove, select all
- Floating contextual toolbar over the selection (recolour, duplicate, order, lock, delete)
- Right-click menu everywhere

### Templates
Fourteen built-in templates with live thumbnails: Brainstorm, SWOT, Kanban, Retrospective,
Project planning, Effective meeting, KWL chart, Frayer model, Mind map, Decision matrix,
Weekly planner, Empathy map, Flowchart starter, Blank.

### Documents (the addition to the original)
`Insert ▸ Document` — or just drag a file onto the canvas — accepts:

| Format | Handled by |
| --- | --- |
| `.pdf` | pdf.js, rendered directly |
| `.docx` `.doc` `.rtf` `.odt` | LibreOffice if installed, otherwise the built-in converter |
| `.pptx` `.ppt` `.odp` | LibreOffice if installed, otherwise the built-in converter |
| `.xlsx` `.xls` `.ods` `.txt` | LibreOffice |

**You choose the pages.** Anything longer than one page opens a picker first: thumbnails of
every page with checkboxes, a range box (`1-3, 7, 10-12`), and a choice of row, grid or
stacked layout. Take page 4 of a 90-page PDF instead of all ninety.

Every page becomes its own independent object on the board - never a group. Annotate over it,
move it, resize it, lock it, export it with the rest of the board. **The ink eraser never
touches it**: in ink mode the eraser only cuts ink, so you can rub an annotation off a page
without harming the page. Removing a whole page is the eraser's explicit "erase whole objects"
mode, or select it and press Delete.

**Quality.** The picker offers Standard (144 dpi), High (216 dpi) and Maximum (300 dpi, print
resolution) with a running estimate of what it will add to the board file. The page's size in
board units is identical at every setting — only the number of pixels behind it changes, so
raising it is purely about how far you can zoom in before it softens.

**Fidelity note.** If LibreOffice is on the machine the app shells out to it
(`soffice --headless --convert-to pdf`) and you get the real layout. If it is not, a built-in
converter runs instead — `mammoth` for Word, a small OOXML reader for PowerPoint — rendered in
a hidden window and printed to PDF. That path is readable rather than pixel-perfect: it keeps
text, formatting, pictures, tables, shape positions and slide geometry, but it does not
reproduce Word's exact pagination or PowerPoint's theme backgrounds. Settings ▸ About tells you
which engine is active. Set `GAZBOARD_DISABLE_LIBREOFFICE=1` to force the built-in path.

### Export and files
- PNG (whole board or just the selection, 2× scale)
- SVG (real vectors — strokes, shapes and text stay editable in Illustrator/Inkscape)
- PDF (A4 / Letter / A3 / Legal / A5 or the board's own shape; portrait or landscape; margins;
  the whole board on one sheet, or tiled at actual size across as many sheets as it takes)
- `.gazboard` document files (Save a copy / Open); `.openboard` files from earlier versions still open
- Autosave to a local board library, browsable from **Boards**

Boards live in `<userData>/boards` — on Windows that is `%APPDATA%\GazBoard\boards`, on
Linux `~/.config/GazBoard/boards`. **Uninstalling does not remove them**, so reinstalling
picks up exactly where you left off. The Boards panel shows the folder and can open it.

Boards are written atomically (temp file plus rename), and which board was open is
recorded in a file by the main process rather than in browser storage — so a machine
that is switched off rather than shut down cleanly still comes back to your work. If
that pointer is ever lost, the app opens the most recent board that has something on
it; it will not greet you with a blank canvas while your boards sit on disk.

# Sharing on your own network

**Settings → Share on this network** is off by default. While off, GazBoard does not open ports, advertise itself, or accept connections.

When enabled, GazBoards on the same Wi-Fi can discover each other and send boards directly. Pair once using a code shown on the receiving computer, then choose **Send this board**.

Transfers are device-to-device, with no server or third-party dependencies, using X25519 and AES-256-GCM through Node's built-in crypto.

GazBoard normally uses:

- **TCP 53318** for transfers
- **UDP 53319** for discovery

If the TCP port is busy, GazBoard chooses another free port and shows it. UDP discovery cannot change ports, so if 53319 is unavailable, automatic discovery stops but **Add a computer by address** still works.

### Pairing

There are two pairing modes:

- **Just for now** — pairing disappears when GazBoard closes. Useful for classrooms or shared computers.
- **Remember these computers** — pairing survives restarts. Useful for your own devices.

### Receiving boards

Nothing is accepted automatically. Before saving, GazBoard shows the sender, board name, size, and a small preview.

If the board already exists, you can **Keep both** or **Replace my copy**. Escape declines the transfer.

A separate checkbox controls whether accepted boards open immediately. It is on by default and remembers your choice.

If several boards arrive together, only the last opens. Replacing the board currently open always reloads it to avoid autosaving an older copy over the replacement.

### Firewall checks

If another computer cannot reach GazBoard, the firewall is usually the cause. GazBoard checks firewall rules without administrator rights and reports what it finds, including the exact executable being checked.

**Windows:** GazBoard can repair the rules. It removes blocking rules first, then allows the current program on Private and Domain/Work networks only. This requires one UAC prompt. It will not open the port on a network marked Public.

**macOS and Linux:** GazBoard detects the active firewall and explains the required fix, but does not change it.

It checks `socketfilterfw` on macOS and firewalld or ufw on Linux. Where permission prevents a reliable check, GazBoard says so instead of guessing.

### Transfers

Large boards can take time because image data expands during encoding and encryption.

GazBoard shows real byte-transfer progress. Once uploading finishes, it says which computer it is waiting for instead of showing a fake percentage while the recipient decides.

The progress dialog can be closed without cancelling the transfer.

### Forgetting computers

Choosing **Forget** removes the pairing locally first, then tells the other computer to forget it too.

If that computer is offline, it removes the pairing the next time it tries to connect.

### Scope

GazBoard sharing is a deliberate file-style handoff, not live collaboration. 

None of this is live collaboration, and it is not meant to be. There are no presence cursors and no shared editing session; a board is a thing you hand over, once, on purpose.

                     board storage, document→PDF conversion
preload.js           The only bridge into the renderer (contextIsolation on, no nodeIntegration)
src/convert.html     Hidden window used by the built-in Office converter
src/js/core/
  store.js           Document model + operation log + undo/redo
  surface.js         Canvas view, culling, draw loop
  camera.js          Pan/zoom transform
  render.js          Every object type, backgrounds, selection chrome
  tools.js           Pointer state machine for all tools
  hit.js             Hit testing, marquee, lasso, eraser sweeps
  recognize.js       Ink → shape classifier
  transform.js       Move / scale / rotate maths

src/js/ui/           Toolbar, popovers, panels, context menu, text editing
```

### About "structured for collaboration later"

Nothing mutates the document directly. Every change is an **operation**
(`add` / `del` / `set` / `order` / `doc`) that is applied, pushed onto the undo stack, and
broadcast on `store.onOp()`. Two methods complete the seam:

```js
const snapshot = store.checkpoint();   // full state, resets the op log
store.applyRemote(ops);                // replay a peer's ops, no undo entry, no echo
```

A sync layer only has to move `checkpoint()` once per peer and then stream ops — the editor
itself needs no changes. The smoke suite asserts this: it checkpoints a board, performs
edits, replays the log into a fresh `Store` and checks the two documents match.

---

## Tests

```bash
npm run smoke            # headless, uses LibreOffice if present
npm run smoke:builtin    # forces the built-in Office converter
npm run test:restart     # kills the app mid-session and checks the board comes back
```

as of 02-Sep-2026, 368 assertions covering boot, ink, partial and whole-object erase, stylus/mouse device roles,
pan-while-drawing and edge auto-pan, shape recognition, notes/text/shapes/tables, undo/redo,
transforms, hit testing, the pen tray, click-away deselect, the zoom readout, the handwriting
font, the pen-nib cursor, the About plate, the handwriting default and its settings migration,
PDF export page sizes and the pages it actually writes, board recovery after an unclean
shutdown, carrying boards over from an older install, lock adoption of ink already drawn, templates, backgrounds, the ruler, PDF/Word/PowerPoint import,
PNG rendering, save/load round-trips, the op-log seam, tool switching and panel UI.
Erase coverage includes the split, the undo restore, a near miss, whole-object mode, and
erasing off the end of a stroke. HiDPI coverage samples the far corner of the canvas buffer at
1x / 1.25x / 1.5x / 2x to prove the whole surface is painted, and the suite is also run end to
end under `--force-device-scale-factor` at each of those scales.
Screenshots and a results file are written to `test/out/`.

## macOS (Special Notes)

GazBoard runs on macOS 11 and later, on both Apple Silicon and Intel. It is the same application —
same boards, same file format, same everything.

**Apple Silicon** takes `GazBoard-<version>-arm64.dmg`; **Intel** takes `GazBoard-<version>.dmg`.
Apple menu →  About This Mac tells you which. The wrong one either will not run at all (arm64 on
Intel) or will run slowly under Rosetta (Intel on Apple Silicon).

### The first launch will be refused, and the message is misleading

macOS will say either *"GazBoard cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"* or,
more alarmingly, ***"GazBoard is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash."***

**Nothing is damaged.** macOS says that about any application not signed with an Apple developer
certificate, which costs $99 a year and has not been bought while the Mac build is still finding
out whether anyone wants it. The file is fine; macOS simply refuses to vouch for it.

To open it:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down to the line about GazBoard being blocked, and click **Open Anyway**
3. Confirm once more

macOS remembers the decision, so this is a first-launch-only step.

If it still refuses with "damaged", the download-quarantine flag your browser attached is the
culprit. Open Terminal and run:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/GazBoard.app
```

The app is ad-hoc signed, which is what lets it run on Apple Silicon at all; what is missing is the
Developer ID and Apple's notarisation. It is built from the same source as the Windows and Linux
downloads, by the same automated workflow.

## Not included

Everything in Microsoft Whiteboard 21.x that only exists because of the Microsoft account:
sign-in, cloud boards, sharing links, real-time co-authoring, presence cursors, reactions,
Bing image search, and the Teams meeting integration. Ink, canvas, objects, templates,
export and settings are all here.
