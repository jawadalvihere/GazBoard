// Ink geometry.
//
// A stroke is drawn as ONE stroked path down its centreline, not as a filled
// outline. That matters:
//
//   * A single ctx.stroke() rasterises the whole stroke once, so a highlighter
//     that crosses itself composites once and cannot darken at the overlap -
//     the blotches that started this rewrite.
//   * Curving through the MIDPOINTS of the input points keeps every segment
//     inside its control triangle, so the path can never overshoot or loop.
//     Offsetting a centreline into a left/right outline has no such guarantee:
//     at a sharp turn the two sides cross and the fill throws out a spike,
//     which is what put barbs on the letters.
//
// Width used to be constant along a whole stroke: the mean pressure set one
// weight and that was that. It matched a felt pen, and it meant that pressing
// harder in the middle of a word did nothing whatsoever - which is not what
// anybody means by pressure sensitivity, and people said so.
//
// Varying it does NOT mean going back to offsetting an outline. The rule above
// still holds and is still why letters have no barbs. Instead a stroke is cut
// into RUNS of neighbouring points that want a similar width, and each run is
// stroked down its own centreline, the same way the whole stroke used to be.
// Runs overlap by a point and the caps are round, so the joins are invisible.
// Opaque ink over opaque ink of the same colour is the same colour, so nothing
// darkens - and the highlighter, which is translucent and WOULD darken at an
// overlap, keeps the single-path route it always had.
