// The firewall, from inside the app - on all three platforms.
//
// Why this file exists at all
// ---------------------------
// The failure it addresses is silent by construction. GazBoard binds its
// socket, the port is genuinely open, `netstat` shows it listening - and every
// packet from the next desk is dropped before it arrives. Nothing in the app
// can feel that from the inside, because a connection to your own machine
// never crosses the firewall. So without something like this, "nobody can see
// me" has no explanation anywhere on screen.
//
// On WINDOWS this is not hypothetical. It is exactly how the first two machines
// this was tested on behaved: listening on 0.0.0.0:53318, visible in
// Get-NetTCPConnection, and Test-NetConnection failing from three feet away.
// The installer runs unelevated (perMachine: false, into the user's own
// profile) so it cannot add a rule at install time; Windows asks instead, once,
// behind whatever the person was doing - and Cancel, Escape or a timeout all
// write a BLOCK rule that is never asked about again. A block beats an allow,
// so the machine is then permanently unreachable.
//
// The layers, in order:
//
//   1. The OS asks its own question. If the person says yes, none of this runs.
//   2. GazBoard READS the firewall - which needs no privileges anywhere - and
//      says plainly what it found.
//   3. Windows only: it offers to fix it, which raises one UAC prompt.
//   4. Everywhere: the exact commands, to copy or hand to whoever administers
//      the machine.
//
// Step 3 stops at Windows on purpose. Elevation on Linux means pkexec and a
// polkit agent that may not exist in the session; on macOS it means an
// osascript password prompt. Both are things this has no way to test, and an
// app that hangs on a privilege prompt is worse than one that hands you a
// command. Detect and explain there; run it only where it can be trusted.
//
// Every failure path ends in "we could not tell", never in a claim that things
// are working.
